-- Q1. Find the titles of all movies directed by Steven Spielberg.

SELECT title
FROM Movie
WHERE director = 'Steven Spielberg';

-- Q2. Find all years that have a movie that received a rating of 4 or 5, and sort them in increasing order.

SELECT DISTINCT m.year
FROM Movie AS m 
LEFT JOIN Rating AS r
ON m.mID = r.mID
WHERE r.stars >= 4
ORDER BY m.year;

-- Q3. Find the titles of all movies that have no ratings.

SELECT title
FROM Movie AS m
LEFT JOIN Rating AS r
ON m.mID = r.mID
WHERE r.stars IS NULL;

--Q4. Some reviewers didn't provide a date with their rating. Find the names of all reviewers who have ratings 
      with a NULL value for the date.

SELECT name
FROM Reviewer
WHERE rID IN (SELECT rID FROM Rating WHERE ratingDate IS NULL);

--Q5. Write a query to return the ratings data in a more readable format: reviewer name, movie title, stars, and ratingDate. 
      Also, sort the data, first by reviewer name, then by movie title, and lastly by number of stars.

SELECT re.name , m.title, ra.stars, ra.ratingDate
FROM Movie AS m
INNER JOIN Rating AS ra
ON m.mID = ra.mID
INNER JOIN Reviewer AS re
ON re.rID = ra.rID
ORDER BY re.name, m.title, ra.stars;

--Q6. For all cases where the same reviewer rated the same movie twice and gave it a higher rating the second time, 
      return the reviewer's name and the title of the movie.
      
SELECT re.name, m.title
FROM Rating AS r1, Rating AS r2
LEFT JOIN Reviewer AS re
ON re.rID = r1.rID
LEFT JOIN Movie AS m
ON m.mID = r1.mID
WHERE r1.rID = r2.rID and r1.mID = r2.mID and r2.ratingDate > r1.ratingDate and r2.stars > r1.stars;         
      
--Q7. For each movie that has at least one rating, find the highest number of stars that movie received. 
      Return the movie title and number of stars. Sort by movie title.
      
SELECT m.title, MAX(ra.stars)
FROM Movie AS M
INNER JOIN Rating AS ra
ON m.mID = ra.mID
WHERE ra.stars IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY m.title
ORDER BY m.title;
      
--Q8. For each movie, return the title and the 'rating spread', that is, the difference between highest
      and lowest ratings given to that movie. Sort by rating spread from highest to lowest, then by movie title.
      
SELECT m.title, (MAX(ra.stars)-MIN(ra.stars)) AS 'rating spread'
FROM Movie AS m
INNER JOIN Rating AS ra
ON m.mID = ra.mID
GROUP BY m.title
ORDER BY (MAX(ra.stars)-MIN(ra.stars)) DESC, m.title;

--Q9. Find the difference between the average rating of movies released before 1980 and the average rating of
      movies released after 1980. (Make sure to calculate the average rating for each movie, then the average of those averages 
      for movies before 1980 and movies after. Don't just calculate the overall average rating before and after 1980.)

SELECT(SELECT AVG(avg_stars)
FROM(
    SELECT AVG(ra.stars) AS avg_stars, m.year 
    FROM Rating AS ra
    INNER JOIN Movie AS m
    ON ra.mID = m.mID
    GROUP BY ra.mID)
WHERE year < 1980)
-
(SELECT AVG(avg_stars)
FROM(
    SELECT AVG(ra.stars) AS avg_stars, m.year
    FROM Rating AS ra
    INNER JOIN Movie AS m
    ON ra.mID = m.mID
    GROUP BY ra.mID) 
WHERE year > 1980);
